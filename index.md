###  ***Introduction***
<br/>

Hello! My name's Leo and I am currently a fourth year majoring in Math-Computer Science. A year ago I was studying Nanoengineering as I had transferred from UCR where I was studying Material Science and Engineering. I only recently discovered my passion for computer science but have been looking for experience anywhere I can get it! I am also a big overthinker so I like to live by the quote:

> "Don't think just do!"

### ***Experience***
<br/>  
While I do not have a lot of out of class experience, a friend and I created a partially unfinished app, called Netflix and Chill, where you would be able to swipe on movie selections and match with others based on movie preferences. Below is a part of our set up code:

```
  <Stack.Screen
    name="Welcome"
    component={Welcome}
    options={{ title: 'Welcome', headerShown: false, }}
  />
  <Stack.Screen
    name="Main"
    component={MainScreen}
    options={{ headerShown: false, }}
  />
```
<br/>

### ***Hobbies***
<br/>

Valorant is currently my most time consuming hobbie that I currently indulge in. I've always loved video games and would love to work in the gaming industry one day.

Another hobby of mine is snowboarding. I have been more busy with academics and job searching that I haven't had the time to this year. I hope to pick up the sport again next season! My snowboard is called the T.Rice Orca because orcas are my favorite animal
